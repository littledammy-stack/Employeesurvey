Dano Airlines: Passenger Satisfaction Recovery Strategy
Role: Data Analyst
Objective: Analyze survey data from 120,000+ passengers to identify why satisfaction dipped below 50% and provide a data-driven recovery plan.

## Executive Summary
Dano Airlines&#39; passenger satisfaction currently stands at 43.4%, failing to meet the leadership&#39;s
50% target. Analysis reveals that while Business Class passengers remain largely satisfied, a
significant portion of Economy and Personal Travel passengers are dissatisfied. To recover, Dano
Airlines must prioritize digital transformation and in-flight service consistency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Passengers Surveyed: 129,880
Overall Satisfaction Rate: 43.4% (Critical)
Average Total Delay: 29.8 Minutes
Primary Satisfaction Driver: Online Boarding (0.50 Correlation)

## Deep Dive: The "Pain Points"
Based on the dashboard analysis, three main segments are dragging down the satisfaction rate:
1. Travel Type: Passengers traveling for Personal reasons are 25% less likely to be satisfied than
business travelers.
2. Travel Class: Economy Class reports significantly lower satisfaction, specifically in Seat Comfort
and Leg Room.
3. Digital Services: In-flight Wifi and Ease of Online Booking received the lowest average ratings
(2.7/5).

## Drivers of Satisfaction (Impact Analysis)
Not every low score is worth fixing. We focused on the factors that actually changes a passenger's
mind.
Online Boarding (Priority 1): Moving a passenger from a rating of 1 to 5 in this category increases their likelihood of being Satisfied by 73%.
In-flight Entertainment (Priority 2): High impact on long-distance flights.
In-flight Wifi (Priority 3): While currently poorly rated, it is the 2nd highest driver of potential satisfaction growth.

## Strategic Recommendations
To get Dano Airlines back above 50% satisfaction by the next survey, I recommend the following
three-pillar strategy: 

Pillar 1: Digital Experience Overhaul
Enhance the Mobile App: Since Online Boarding is the 1 driver, the app must be foolproof.
Streamline the check-in and boarding pass retrieval process.
Wifi Infrastructure: Upgrade satellite connectivity. Even a moderate improvement in Wifi speeds
will capture the younger tech-savvy demographic currently rating us poorly.

Pillar 2: The Economy Plus Experience
Seat Entertainment: Improve the value proposition for Economy passengers. Small
investments in seat cushioning and updated movie libraries will disproportionately increase
satisfaction in this high-volume segment.

Pillar 3: Operational Efficiency
Manage Expectations during Delays: Data shows satisfaction drops sharply after a 60-minute
total delay. Implement proactive communication strategies.
